the ingredients are really whatever you want its a good idea to have some basics to start with for me these are
lettuce
tomato
cucumber
spring onion
this recipe uses the left-overs from my almost jerk chicken. you can use whatever you have in the fridge
homemade salad dressing
exciting stuff for flavour like gherkins, pickled chili, chili flakes, spicy olives or maybe garlic cloves in olive oil
